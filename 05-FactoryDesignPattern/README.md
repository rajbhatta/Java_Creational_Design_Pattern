## 1. Factory design pattern with real world example using Java Swing ##
Inside the factory design pattern, I have created a form to place an electronic delivery order using a factory. If we select a mobile, then we will place an electronic delivery order for mobile and if we select a laptop then we will place an electronic delivery order for Laptop.
