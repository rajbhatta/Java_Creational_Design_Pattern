## What is creational design pattern ##
Creational design pattern defines how the object is created beside instantiating with new.


## Some of the example of creation design pattern ##
### 1. Singleton Pattern ###
Introduction 

-It guarantee that only instance is created. 
-It guarantee control of a resource

Example
- Runtime
- Logger
- Spring Bean
- Graphic Manager

### 2. Builder Pattern ###
Design consideration

Handle complex constructor
Enforce immutability once object is created.
It can be implemented by creating a separate class for static.
It doesn't require interface but we can implement it with interface if required.
Can be worked with legacy code.

### 3. Prototype Pattern ###
Design consideration

It avoids costly creation operation:
Avoid subclassing: we create an instance of the actual prototype that we are trying to work with.
Typically doesn't use new keyword: the first instance created might use keyword new after that it is cloned.
Often utilize an interface
Usually implemented with a registery.
Example: java.lang.object#clone()
