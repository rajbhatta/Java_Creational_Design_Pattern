## Design Consideration ##
- Class is responsible for lifecycle
- Static in nature
- Needs to be thread safe
- Private instance
- Private Constructor
- No parameters are required for construction.
 If parameter is required then it may factory pattern and it violates the principle of singleton pattern
 
 ## How we can utilize singleton ##
 
 ### 1. Singleton pattern without lazyloading ##
 
 
 ### 2. Singleton pattern with lazyloading ###
 
 
 ### 3. Singleton pattern with lazyloading and threadsafe ###
